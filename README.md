The aim of this project is to determine what qualities make a good cup of coffee. The analysis is based on data extracted from the Coffee Quality Institute, an independent entity that supports producers by providing education that gives them options to improve the quality of their coffee. 

Background Information

Since 1996, Coffee Quality Institute (CQI) has worked to improve the quality of coffee and the lives of people who produce it. Quality is one of the most important variables that influence a coffeeâ€™s value. However, many producers do not have access to the tools and support they need to understand the quality of their coffee, improve that quality, access markets that reward that quality, ultimately enabling them to make more informed business choices.

The database used for the analysis was created by scrapping the website of the CQI in January 2018 and contains a reference for each sample sent for grading and analysis from its foundation. This means that each line of the database represents one sample sent by a coffee producer at a given time. 

Dataset limits

In order to get a sample graded the coffee producer needs to make a payment to the CQI. One of the main questions that arise from this practice is to wonder what are the benefits for a coffee producer to be graded. Is the farmer seeking a quality seal? Or does the farmer maybe need to reach a minimum grading to be eligible to be considered for export? These considerations make us believe that the analysis results need to be considered wisely.
